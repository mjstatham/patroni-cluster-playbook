postgresql role

1. Allow for the the data_dir to be overidden (this has been done in my role)
2. Why do we have the data dir defined in 2 places ?
  postgresql_data_dir: "/mnt/disks/pgdata/12/main"
  postgresql_global_config_options:

pg-playbook

1. Ensure that the postgres service is disabled on bootup
2. Move bootstrap.sh steps into the pg12-playbook
3. Add the cleanup steps before image creation to the pg-playbook
4. Create image as part of the pg-playbook
5. Maybe we dont need the data dir when creating the image
